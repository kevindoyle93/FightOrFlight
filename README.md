# FightOrFlight

My first OOP assignment was an arcade-style game, made in Processing. I decided to create a space shooter. 

Fight Or Flight is a 2D space shooter involving surviving waves of enemies that can shoot at you, and dodging asteroids. You can collect power-ups along the way such as health and ammo. The ammo is important, as you must decide whether to go all guns blazing or try to conserve ammo. Hence the name of the game!
